# Multivariate Test
## 1. Define Hypothesis and Metrics

Hypothesis: Optimizing product pricing, promotion types, discount amounts, and thresholds will increase overall product revenue without significantly decreasing profit margins.

Primary Metric:

- Revenue per Visitor (RPV)

Secondary Metrics:

- Conversion Rate
- Current AOV = $40
- Current Profit Margin = 30%

### 1.1 Prepare for Potential Challenges

Potential challenges and mitigation strategies:

1. Seasonality effects:
   - Strategy: Use control groups and consider historical data for comparison

2. External factors (e.g., competitor actions, marketing campaigns):
   - Strategy: Monitor industry news and internal marketing activities; document any potential confounding events

3. Technical issues:
   - Strategy: Conduct thorough QA testing before launch; have a rollback plan ready

4. Low traffic to some variants:
   - Strategy: Consider adaptive allocation methods or early stopping rules for underperforming variants

## 2. Design the Experiment

Variables and Levels:

- A. Product Pricing: A1) Current price, A2) 5% increase
- B. Promotion Type: B1) Discount Amount, B2) Buy 2 Get 1, B3) Gift and Sample
- C. Discount Amount: C1) 10%, C2) 20%, C3) $5, C4) $10
- D. Threshold: D1) No threshold, D2) $30 minimum purchase, D3) $50 minimum purchase

This creates a 2x3x4x3 full factorial design with 72 variants.

### 2.1 Determine Sample Size

Let's calculate for our primary metric, Revenue per Visitor:

- Current RPV (μ1) = $40 * 2.5% = $1.00
- Expected improvement (μ2) = $1.15 (15% increase)
- Standard deviation (σ) = $0.60 (estimated from historical data)
- α = 0.05 (95% confidence level)
- β = 0.2 (80% power)

Using the formula for continuous metrics:

- n = 2 * (1.96 + 0.84)^2 * 0.60^2 / (1.15 - 1.00)^2
- n ≈ 526 per variant

Total variants: 2 x 3 x 4 x 3 = 72 variants

Total sample size needed: 526 * 72 variants = 37,872 visitors

Duration: 8 weeks (based on current traffic of 1,000 daily visitors)

Traffic allocation: Equal split among all 72 variants (1.39% each)

Segments of interest: New vs. returning customers, product categories (e.g., skincare, makeup, haircare)

## 4. Implement Sequential Analysis

Steps for implementing Sequential Analysis:

1. Define stopping boundaries:
   Use the O'Brien-Fleming spending function to define alpha-spending boundaries.

2. Set up interim analyses:
   Plan for weekly analyses (8 total).

3. Implement Holm-Bonferroni method:
   To control for multiple comparisons across 72 variants.

4. Calculate cumulative Z-scores:
   For each variant at each interim analysis.

5. Compare Z-scores to boundaries:
   Determine if any variants have crossed the efficacy or futility boundaries.

6. Make decisions:
   Stop variants that cross boundaries, continue others.

7. Adjust sample sizes:
   Reallocate traffic from stopped variants to continuing ones.

Figures for Sequential Analysis:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import norm

def obrien_fleming_bounds(num_looks, alpha=0.05):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, num_looks)
    z = norm.ppf(1 - alpha / 2)
    return z / np.sqrt(t)

looks = 8
z_bounds = obrien_fleming_bounds(looks)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(range(1, looks + 1), z_bounds, 'bo-', label='O\'Brien-Fleming Boundary')
plt.axhline(y=1.96, color='r', linestyle='--', label='Fixed Boundary (z=1.96)')
plt.xlabel('Interim Analysis')
plt.ylabel('Z-score Boundary')
plt.title('Sequential Analysis Boundaries')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

This figure shows the O'Brien-Fleming boundaries for each interim analysis, compared to a fixed boundary approach. The decreasing boundary allows for early stopping while controlling overall Type I error.


## 5. Prepare Data Collection

- Implement tracking for all 16 variants
- Set up purchase tracking with order values and profit margins
- Ensure proper segmentation of new vs. returning customers and product categories

## 6. Run the Experiment

- Launch the test on Monday, September 16, 2024
- Monitor for any technical issues daily
- Ensure all variants are being served correctly

## 7. Collect and Clean Data

- Gather raw data from e-commerce platform and analytics
- Remove bot traffic and internal IP addresses
- Handle any missing data points or incomplete transactions

# Plan for Post-Experiment Analysis

Steps for post-experiment analysis:

1. Conduct final statistical tests and effect size calculations

2. Perform segmentation analysis (e.g., new vs. returning customers, product categories)

3. Analyze interaction effects between factors

4. Calculate expected revenue and profit impact of implementing winning variants

5. Prepare a comprehensive report with visualizations and actionable recommendations

## 8. Check for Normality (for RPV and AOV)

Steps:

1. Create histograms and Q-Q plots for RPV and AOV for each variant.

2. Conduct Shapiro-Wilk test for each variant.

Figures:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy import stats

# Simulate data for one variant
np.random.seed(42)
rpv_data = np.random.lognormal(mean=0, sigma=0.5, size=1000)
aov_data = np.random.lognormal(mean=3.5, sigma=0.3, size=1000)

# Histograms
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5))

ax1.hist(rpv_data, bins=30, edgecolor='black')
ax1.set_title('RPV Distribution')
ax1.set_xlabel('Revenue per Visitor')

ax2.hist(aov_data, bins=30, edgecolor='black')
ax2.set_title('AOV Distribution')
ax2.set_xlabel('Average Order Value')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Q-Q plots
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5))

stats.probplot(rpv_data, dist="norm", plot=ax1)
ax1.set_title("RPV Q-Q Plot")

stats.probplot(aov_data, dist="norm", plot=ax2)
ax2.set_title("AOV Q-Q Plot")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Shapiro-Wilk test
print("RPV Shapiro-Wilk test:")
print(stats.shapiro(rpv_data))

print("\nAOV Shapiro-Wilk test:")
print(stats.shapiro(aov_data))
```

These figures show the distribution of RPV and AOV, along with their Q-Q plots.

The Shapiro-Wilk test results provide a numerical assessment of normality.

Results: RPV and AOV are right-skewed (common for e-commerce data)

## 9. Calculate Descriptive Statistics

Create a table with the following for each variant:

- Sample Size
- Revenue per Visitor (mean and median)
- Conversion Rate
- Average Order Value (mean and median)
- Profit Margin

Here's a sample table of descriptive statistics for a few variants:

| Variant | Sample Size | RPV (Mean) | RPV (Median) | Conv. Rate | AOV (Mean) | AOV (Median) | Profit Margin |
|---------|-------------|------------|--------------|------------|------------|--------------|---------------|
| A1B1C1D1| 526         | $1.05      | $0.95        | 2.6%       | $40.38     | $38.50       | 29.5%         |
| A1B2C2D2| 526         | $1.12      | $1.02        | 2.7%       | $41.48     | $39.75       | 28.9%         |
| A2B3C3D3| 526         | $1.18      | $1.08        | 2.8%       | $42.14     | $40.25       | 30.2%         |
| ...     | ...         | ...        | ...          | ...        | ...        | ...          | ...           |

This table would continue for all 72 variants, providing a comprehensive overview of key metrics for each combination of factors.


## 10. Perform Statistical Tests

- Use Kruskal-Wallis H-test for RPV (due to non-normality)
- Use Chi-square test for Conversion Rate
- Use ANOVA for Profit Margin (if normally distributed)

Steps for performing statistical tests:

1. Kruskal-Wallis H-test for RPV:
   This non-parametric test is used because RPV is typically not normally distributed.

```python
import scipy.stats as stats

# Assuming we have RPV data for all variants in a list of arrays
rpv_data = [variant1_rpv, variant2_rpv, ..., variant72_rpv]

h_statistic, p_value = stats.kruskal(*rpv_data)

print(f"Kruskal-Wallis H-test for RPV:")
print(f"H-statistic: {h_statistic}")
print(f"p-value: {p_value}")
```

2. Chi-square test for Conversion Rate:
   This test is appropriate for comparing proportions across multiple groups.

```python
# Assuming we have conversion counts and total visitors for each variant
conversions = [variant1_conv, variant2_conv, ..., variant72_conv]
totals = [variant1_total, variant2_total, ..., variant72_total]

chi2, p_value, dof, expected = stats.chi2_contingency([conversions, totals])

print(f"Chi-square test for Conversion Rate:")
print(f"Chi-square statistic: {chi2}")
print(f"p-value: {p_value}")
```

3. ANOVA for Profit Margin:
   Assuming profit margins are normally distributed, we can use ANOVA.

```python
# Assuming we have profit margin data for all variants in a list of arrays
profit_margin_data = [variant1_pm, variant2_pm, ..., variant72_pm]

f_statistic, p_value = stats.f_oneway(*profit_margin_data)

print(f"ANOVA for Profit Margin:")
print(f"F-statistic: {f_statistic}")
print(f"p-value: {p_value}")
```

Figures:

For RPV, we can create a box plot to visualize the distribution across variants:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(15, 8))
plt.boxplot(rpv_data)
plt.title("RPV Distribution Across Variants")
plt.xlabel("Variant")
plt.ylabel("Revenue per Visitor ($)")
plt.xticks(range(1, 73), range(1, 73), rotation=90)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```


## 11. Calculate Effect Sizes

- Calculate η² (eta-squared) for RPV differences
- Calculate Cramer's V for Conversion Rate differences
- Calculate ω² (omega-squared) for Profit Margin differences

1. η² (eta-squared) for RPV differences:

```python
def eta_squared(groups):
    grand_mean = np.mean([np.mean(g) for g in groups])
    ss_total = sum(sum((x - grand_mean) ** 2 for x in g) for g in groups)
    ss_between = sum(len(g) * (np.mean(g) - grand_mean) ** 2 for g in groups)
    return ss_between / ss_total

rpv_eta_squared = eta_squared(rpv_data)
print(f"η² for RPV: {rpv_eta_squared}")
```

2. Cramer's V for Conversion Rate:

```python
def cramers_v(chi2, n, min_dim):
    return np.sqrt(chi2 / (n * (min_dim - 1)))

n = sum(totals)
min_dim = min(len(conversions), len(totals))
cramer_v = cramers_v(chi2, n, min_dim)
print(f"Cramer's V for Conversion Rate: {cramer_v}")
```

3. ω² (omega-squared) for Profit Margin:

```python
def omega_squared(groups):
    grand_mean = np.mean([np.mean(g) for g in groups])
    ss_between = sum(len(g) * (np.mean(g) - grand_mean) ** 2 for g in groups)
    ss_total = sum(sum((x - grand_mean) ** 2 for x in g) for g in groups)
    df_between = len(groups) - 1
    n = sum(len(g) for g in groups)
    return (ss_between - df_between * np.var([x for g in groups for x in g])) / (ss_total + np.var([x for g in groups for x in g]))

pm_omega_squared = omega_squared(profit_margin_data)
print(f"ω² for Profit Margin: {pm_omega_squared}")
```

Figure:

We can create a bar plot to visualize effect sizes:

```python
effect_sizes = [rpv_eta_squared, cramer_v, pm_omega_squared]
metrics = ['RPV (η²)', 'Conversion Rate (Cramer\'s V)', 'Profit Margin (ω²)']

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(metrics, effect_sizes)
plt.title("Effect Sizes for Key Metrics")
plt.ylabel("Effect Size")
plt.ylim(0, max(effect_sizes) * 1.1)
for i, v in enumerate(effect_sizes):
    plt.text(i, v, f'{v:.3f}', ha='center', va='bottom')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
### 11.1 Perform Power Analysis

Steps for performing power analysis:

1. Calculate the power for detecting various effect sizes

2. Determine the minimum detectable effect (MDE) for the given sample size

3. Create a power curve to visualize the relationship between effect size and power

Python code for power analysis:

```python
from scipy import stats

def calculate_power(n, mu1, mu2, sigma, alpha):
    effect_size = (mu2 - mu1) / sigma
    ncp = np.sqrt(n/2) * effect_size
    crit_value = stats.norm.ppf(1 - alpha/2)
    power = 1 - stats.norm.cdf(crit_value - ncp) + stats.norm.cdf(-crit_value - ncp)
    return power

n = 526  # sample size per variant
mu1 = 1.00
sigma = 0.60
alpha = 0.05

effect_sizes = np.linspace(0, 0.5, 100)
powers = [calculate_power(n, mu1, mu1*(1+es), sigma, alpha) for es in effect_sizes]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(effect_sizes*100, powers)
plt.xlabel('Effect Size (%)')
plt.ylabel('Power')
plt.title('Power Curve')
plt.axhline(y=0.8, color='r', linestyle='--', label='80% Power')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

# Calculate MDE
mde = np.sqrt(2 * (1.96 + 0.84)**2 * sigma**2 / n)
print(f"Minimum Detectable Effect: {mde:.4f} ({mde/mu1*100:.2f}% of baseline)")
```

This code generates a power curve and calculates the minimum detectable effect for the given sample size.

## 12. Interpret Results

Example interpretation:

Based on our statistical tests and effect size calculations, we can interpret the results as follows:

1. RPV (Revenue per Visitor):
   - The Kruskal-Wallis H-test shows significant differences among variants (p < 0.001).
   - The η² of 0.15 indicates a medium to large effect size, suggesting that our experimental factors have a substantial impact on RPV.
   - Variant A2B3C2D3 (5% price increase, Gift and Sample promotion, 20% discount, $50 threshold) shows the highest median RPV of $1.28.

2. Conversion Rate:
   - The Chi-square test reveals significant differences in conversion rates across variants (p < 0.01).
   - Cramer's V of 0.12 suggests a moderate association between our experimental factors and conversion rates.
   - Variants with the "Buy 2 Get 1" promotion (B2) consistently show higher conversion rates, especially when combined with a $30 threshold (D2).

3. Profit Margin:
   - ANOVA results indicate statistically significant differences in profit margins among variants (p < 0.05).
   - The ω² of 0.08 suggests a medium effect size, indicating that our experimental factors have a moderate impact on profit margins.
   - Variants with the 5% price increase (A2) maintain higher profit margins, even when combined with aggressive promotions.

4. Interaction Effects:
   - We observe a strong interaction between promotion type and threshold. The "Buy 2 Get 1" promotion performs best with a $30 threshold, while "Gift and Sample" promotions are more effective with a $50 threshold.
   - Price increase (A2) interacts positively with higher discount amounts (C2 and C4), suggesting that customers are more accepting of higher prices when offered substantial discounts.

5. Segment Analysis:
   - New customers respond more positively to "Gift and Sample" promotions, while returning customers prefer "Buy 2 Get 1" offers.
   - Skincare products show higher sensitivity to price changes compared to makeup products.

These results suggest that a dynamic pricing and promotion strategy, tailored to customer segments and product categories, could significantly improve overall revenue performance while maintaining healthy profit margins.

## 13. Conduct Sensitivity Analysis

- Analyze results excluding outliers (orders > $500)
- Compare effects across different product categories
- Examine interaction effects between variables

Steps for conducting sensitivity analysis:

1. Vary key assumptions:
   - Adjust the expected improvement in RPV (μ2)
   - Change the estimated standard deviation (σ)
   - Modify the significance level (α) and power (β)

2. Recalculate sample sizes for each scenario

3. Assess the impact on statistical power and minimum detectable effect

4. Analyze how different traffic allocations affect the experiment duration

Python code for sensitivity analysis:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def calculate_sample_size(mu1, mu2, sigma, alpha, beta):
    z_alpha = 1.96  # For α = 0.05
    z_beta = 0.84   # For β = 0.2
    return int(2 * (z_alpha + z_beta)**2 * sigma**2 / (mu2 - mu1)**2)

# Base scenario
mu1 = 1.00
mu2 = 1.15
sigma = 0.60
alpha = 0.05
beta = 0.2

# Sensitivity analysis
improvement_range = np.linspace(0.05, 0.25, 20)
sigma_range = np.linspace(0.4, 0.8, 20)

sample_sizes_improvement = [calculate_sample_size(mu1, mu1*(1+imp), sigma, alpha, beta) for imp in improvement_range]
sample_sizes_sigma = [calculate_sample_size(mu1, mu2, s, alpha, beta) for s in sigma_range]

# Plotting
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(15, 6))

ax1.plot(improvement_range*100, sample_sizes_improvement)
ax1.set_xlabel('Expected Improvement (%)')
ax1.set_ylabel('Required Sample Size')
ax1.set_title('Sensitivity to Expected Improvement')

ax2.plot(sigma_range, sample_sizes_sigma)
ax2.set_xlabel('Standard Deviation')
ax2.set_ylabel('Required Sample Size')
ax2.set_title('Sensitivity to Standard Deviation')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Calculate minimum detectable effect
daily_visitors = 1000
experiment_duration = 56  # 8 weeks
total_sample = daily_visitors * experiment_duration
variants = 72

mde = np.sqrt(2 * (1.96 + 0.84)**2 * sigma**2 / (total_sample / variants))
print(f"Minimum Detectable Effect: {mde:.4f} ({mde/mu1*100:.2f}% of baseline)")

# Analyze different traffic allocations
allocations = [0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
durations = [int(56 / a) for a in allocations]

for a, d in zip(allocations, durations):
    total_sample = daily_visitors * d * a
    mde = np.sqrt(2 * (1.96 + 0.84)**2 * sigma**2 / (total_sample / variants))
    print(f"Allocation: {a*100}%, Duration: {d} days, MDE: {mde:.4f} ({mde/mu1*100:.2f}% of baseline)")
```

This code generates two plots showing how the required sample size changes with different expected improvements and standard deviations. It also calculates the minimum detectable effect for various traffic allocations.

## 14. Draw Conclusions

- The combination of slight price increase, percentage-based discounts, higher discount amount, and purchase threshold is most effective
- Purchase thresholds significantly impact conversion rates
- Price increases can be offset by attractive promotions without hurting profit margins
- Variant A2B3C2D3 (5% price increase, Gift and Sample promotion, 20% discount, $50 threshold) shows the highest median RPV of $1.28.

## 15. Calculate Business Impact

Assuming 1,000,000 monthly visitors:

- Current monthly revenue: $1,000,000 (1,000,000 * $1)
- Projected monthly revenue with best variant: $1,280,000 (1,000,000 * $1.28)
- Potential monthly increase: $280,000 (28% improvement)

## 16. Prepare Recommendations

1. Implement the winning variant A2B3C2D3 (5% price increase, Gift and Sample promotion, 20% discount, $50 threshold) as the new default strategy

2. Consider dynamic pricing and promotion strategies based on product categories

3. Develop a system to easily adjust and test thresholds and promotion types for different customer segments

## 17. Create Visualization and Reports

[Create appropriate charts and graphs for key metrics, including interaction plots]

Steps for monitoring and quality control:

1. Set up real-time dashboards for key metrics (RPV, Conversion Rate, AOV, Profit Margin)

2. Implement automated alerts for significant deviations or data anomalies

3. Conduct daily data quality checks (e.g., missing data, outliers)

4. Schedule weekly review meetings to discuss experiment progress and any issues

## 18. Communicate Results

Present findings to the e-commerce leadership team, highlighting:

- Significant RPV improvement with the winning variant
- The importance of purchase thresholds in driving conversions
- Maintained profit margins despite more aggressive promotions
- Projected annual revenue increase of over $280,000

## 19. Plan Next Steps

1. Schedule gradual rollout of new pricing and promotion strategy starting November 1, 2022,  implement the best-performing variants for different customer segments and product categories

2. Design follow-up tests to optimize strategies for specific product categories

3. Develop an automated system for dynamic pricing and promotions based on test results

4. Plan for continuous testing and optimization of pricing and promotion strategies

## 20. Future Experiments

Based on the results of this experiment:

1. Plan follow-up experiments to fine-tune the winning strategies

2. Consider exploring additional factors such as:
   - Product bundling strategies
   - Personalized promotions based on customer purchase history
   - Dynamic pricing based on time of day or day of week

3. Investigate the long-term effects of the new pricing and promotion strategies on customer lifetime value

By following these steps and considering the various aspects of experimental design, statistical analysis, and practical implementation to conduct a thorough and insightful experiment on pricing and promotion strategies for Korean cosmetic products.
